## Overview
The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a MERN stack-based web platform designed to efficiently manage employee records, attendance, roles, leave applications, and claims. 

The frontend is built with **React.js**, utilizing reusable components, hooks, and responsive design. The system integrates **REST APIs** to handle employee data, leave requests, and attendance tracking. It provides **secure role-based access** using JWT authentication, ensuring that admins, HR personnel, and employees can access only the data relevant to them.

EMS streamlines HR operations through an **admin dashboard**, real-time notifications, and automated workflows, reducing paperwork and improving overall organizational efficiency.
